# apiExercise

With the main objective of displaying books according to each end point such as:

● GET /api/books - Get a list of all books.

● GET /api/books/{id} - Get details of a specific book by ID.

● POST /api/books - Add a new book.

● PUT /api/books/{id} - Update an existing book by ID.

● DELETE /api/books/{id} - Delete a book by ID.

I managed to do the part in java where I have two end points, GET /api/books and GET /api/books/{id}, I could do the rest of the endpoints but I only did these to test.

I've also made DTOS, Entity (Book), Services, Converters, Persistence and some xml files but they're not working and that's where my problem lies and why I haven't advanced any further in the project.

I can establish a connection with mysql, but it doesn't recognize my database.
